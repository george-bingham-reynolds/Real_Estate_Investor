# Real_Estate_Investor

This project contains a virtual Real Estate Investor as the end product, with a queryable API containing predictions for return on investment for real estate purchases. The general flow of the repo is laid out below from upstream work to downstream. Natural sections for consideration are titled. Please note that I am not an investment advisor, and no purchases should be made based on predictions.
